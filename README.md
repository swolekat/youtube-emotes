# youtube-emotes
json of youtube emotes for use in chat clients.

I built my own chat client and it was annoying since nothing really provided emotes for youtube. I've made a json file that anyone can use.

One note is that I request 500x500 images. If you want to change the dimension edit the `w500-h500` part of the url.
